### Project Title

**Data-Structure-Array**

### Project Status

Completed

Further improvements can be made by adding more features such as reset(), insert(), push_back() functions, etc. in the future version.

### Project Description

The project is about implementing a custom array data structure in modern `C++17` using object-oriented programming (OOP) model. To highlight the OOP model, the following programming constructs have been used in developing the project. However, the list may grow or change depending on available resources (e.g. time) in the future:

- Class
- Operator overloading
- Move semantics
- Exception
- Template
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Design pattern

### Usage

Both header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files can be found in the folder `MyArray`.

Users are requested to compile and build the codes in `Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 (Version 16.6.3.)` as I successfully built the project in this version of MSVS IDE.

Since the test codes are also provided in the same folder, users are encouraged to play with the test codes to enhance their understanding about the codes. Users are also encouraged to add more tests codes to increase the robustness of the current implementations as well.

Hands of suggestions, comments, feedback or collaboration will be highly appreciated.

### Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

### Acknowledgement

The course `Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms` in C++' in Pluralsight was very helpful to understand problems and to generate ideas to implement own custom data structures. I would like to thank the instructor `Giovanni Dicanio` and `Pluralsight` for creating a very useful course.
